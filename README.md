This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using the MERN stack. It allows users to manage books and students within an educational institution.

Technologies Used
MongoDB Atlas: Used as the database for storing book and student information.
Express.js: Used for building the backend server, handling HTTP requests, and routing.
React.js: Used for developing the frontend user interface, providing a dynamic and interactive experience for users.
Node.js: Serves as the runtime environment for running the backend server and executing server-side logic.
Heroku: Utilized as the cloud platform for deploying the backend server, ensuring availability and scalability.

Deployment
The application is deployed using Heroku for the backend. The frontend is deployed separately using Netlify.

Features
CRUD Operations: Users can perform CRUD operations on both books and students.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Admin users have access to all functionalities, while student users have limited access.
Authentication: Secure authentication mechanisms using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are implemented to ensure secure access to the application.
